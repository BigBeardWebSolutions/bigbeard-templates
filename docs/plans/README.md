# BigBeard Templates - Plans

Implementation plans are stored here before execution. Each plan follows the TBT mechanism:

1. **Plan** — Define the approach, steps, and expected outcomes
2. **Review** — User reviews and approves the plan
3. **Execute** — Implement the plan turn-by-turn
4. **Verify** — SDET verification after execution
5. **Log** — Record outcomes in `docs/logs/history.md`
